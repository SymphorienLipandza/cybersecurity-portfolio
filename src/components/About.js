            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience across network security, backend development, and system architecture gained through focused internships and real-world projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a Master’s in Cybersecurity (in progress) and certifications including CCNA, CCNP and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, I’ve built secure APIs, configured firewalls, implemented role-based access controls, and collaborated on platforms designed for safety, performance, and resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe in securing digital infrastructure end-to-end from backend systems to enterprise networks while continuously learning and applying new tools. My current focus is on leveraging cloud security, DevSecOps practices, and scalable backend design to protect and power digital environments.
